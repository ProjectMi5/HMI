This should serve as a basic structure for HMI development.

## Usage

* There is a sample server, based on node-opcua: misc/sampleserver.js
Start the server with:
	node sampleserver.js

* In the same folder you can find a uaexpert file, that connects to this localhost server.
Use this tool to check OPC UA variables.
Also check with the tool, if the sample server is implemented correctly, if something fails.
